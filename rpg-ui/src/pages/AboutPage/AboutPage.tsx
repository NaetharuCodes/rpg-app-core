            When I was 13 years old I was taken into foster care. As with many
            kids in that situation, I had no possessions with me beyond the
            clothes on my back. The first night I was there, my foster brother -
            who was in his late twenties at the time, bio child of my foster
            parents - gave me an old RPG game as something to do. It was an off
            beat 1980s super hero game called Heroes Unlimited. A kind of knock
            off Marvel setting.
          </p>

          <p>I loved that game.</p>

          <p>
            I spent all my time creating stories for it, reading the rules, and
            thinking about how I could create cool adventures. Soon I found D&D,
            after 3rd edition came out, and got into that. I loved game
            mastering from the outset. Creating stories, and sharing my worlds
            with other people.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there I kept going. I had a period of time when I did some LARP
            too. But I have always been mostly interested in tabletop. I love
            storytelling, and the narrative aspect of games. I also love to
            explore all kinds of games, and try out interesting settings and fun
            themes that fall outside the core RPG fantasy content.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years I've created many games. From long campaigns to short
            one-shots.
          </p>

            I'm a software developer working in fintech by day. So I decided to
            put my two loves together - making RPG games and making software -
            and create this platform. This app is a way for me to share those
            games with people. And to provide both myself and others with a
            toolset to make great games.
          </p>

          <p>
            My focus here is, as I said, on the narrative side. I've created
            Simple D6 - my custom rules system - with that in mind. I want
            people to play games, and have fun. So my rules are designed to be
            very easy to learn.
          </p>

          <p>I really hope that people enjoy my games.</p>
